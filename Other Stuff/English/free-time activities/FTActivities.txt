Good day everyone! My name is Daniil Talashkevich and today I'm going to talk about FT-activities. So let's start!

I've divided my presentation into 3 parts. They are:
    1) What FT-activities are?
    2) The types of activities people choose in nowadays
    3) What activities do I prefer?

    // 4) Summary. (сАмари)



            Let’s start my presentation.

    1) Firstly, I’d like to tell you about what FT and FT-activities are:

Free time is the time that remains after doing the necessary things including homework, housework, job stuff and others.
Therefore, FT-activities are activities when people can relax from daily routine and have fun.

    2) One more interesting thing to say about is What types of FT-activities are available?

A lot of people like to do housework or meet with their friends in their free time. Other prefer to do physical activity and read books.
But nowadays, most people prefer to spend their free time on the phone, watching funny videos. And this activity is so bad in the long run, because by doing it they ruin their health and waste time.

    3) Let’s now turn to activities that I prefer the most?:

As for me I prefer to spend free time reading books and doing various of physical activities, because I believe this activities influence on me in the best way and I pretty like them.
Reading helps me to learn something new, in other words, helps me to keep my mind fit. And sport helps me to keep my body fit.

    4) Let's summarize

Nowadays there are many different hobbies, so a modern person can find something to do, based on his interests.
But for some reasons a lot of people prefer to spend time with the phone over doing useful things.
